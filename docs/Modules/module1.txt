The first thing that we are going to learn is variable assignment!
Variables in programming allow us to save information for later

Text:
Lets learn what this means!
Click on the "add variable" button at the bottom of the screen

Text:
See how a block appeared on the screen? 
This is the first thing that happens when you make a program

Text:
Before we can run the program, we need to fill out some information
in the variable. 

Text:
In the first text box, type the name "numberone".
This is the name we will use when we want to use it again.

Text:
Next, in the next text box, we need to give numberone a value.
type "1" in the box to give numberone a value of one.

Text:
Click the "add variable" button at the bottom of the screen again

Text:
This time, give the variable the name "numbertwo" and the value 2.

Text:
And finally, to end the program, hit the end program button on the bottom to close the program.

Text:
Now, we can run the program! Hit the green triangle button to start
running the program!

Text:
See the arrow? This is where the program is currently running.
To advance the program, hit the "Next Block" button on the left 
to see what happens next.

Text:
Look where the arrow is now! It is pointing at the numberone block.
Also, look in the top right corner! You can see that numberone = 1!

Text:
This means that the value one is stored in the variable numberone. 
Hit the "Next Block" button to see what happens next.

Text:
Now look back at the top right corner! You can see numberone and numbertwo! These are the variables
