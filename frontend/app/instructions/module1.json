    "Hello, and welcome to learning to program! Hit the next tip button to see what to do next.",
    "The first thing that we are going to learn is variable assignment! Variables in programming allow us to save information for later",
    "Lets learn what this means! Click on the 'add variable' button at the bottom of the screen",
    "See how a block appeared on the screen?  This is the first thing that happens when you make a program",
    "Before we can run the program, we need to fill out some information in the variable. ",
    "In the first text box, type the name 'numberone'. This is the name we will use when we want to use it again.",
    "Next, in the next text box, we need to give numberone a value. type '1' in the box to give numberone a value of one.",
    "Click the 'add variable' button at the bottom of the screen again ",
    "This time, give the variable the name 'numbertwo' and the value 2. ",
    "And finally, to end the program, hit the end program button on the bottom to close the program. ",
    "Now, we can run the program! Hit the 'Start Program' button to start running the program!",
    "See the arrow? This is where the program is currently running. To advance the program, hit the 'Next Block' button on the left to see what happens next",
    "Look where the arrow is now! It is pointing at the numberone block. Also, look in the top right corner! You can see that numberone = 1!",
    "This means that the value one is stored in the variable numberone.  Hit the 'Next Block' button to see what happens next.",
    "Now look back at the top right corner! You can see numberone and numbertwo! These are the variables in the program. ",
    "Now click the 'Stop Program' button. The program will stop running and the variables will dissapear.  ",
    "Now lets try some more complicated variables. Add a new variable with the name numberthree.",
    "Lets use our previous variables to make this new variable! In the value box, type 'numberone + numbertwo'",
    "Lets see the result of what this does!  Run the program until the arrow is at the numberthree block",
    "If we look at the variables for the program, we see that  numberthree has a value of three!",
    "This makes sense because if numberone is the same as 1, and numbertwo is the same as 2, then 1 + 2 = 3 ",
    "Since we are running out of time in this module, I will just say that all of the other math that you know works in these variables! For example, 3 * 4 is allowed to be a value, and would mean that the variable then has a value of 12. 4 - 3 works as well, as well as 8 / 4.",
    "If you want, you can continue to add variables and see their values, but for now, you have completed Module 1! Congratulations! Click the 'Next Module' button when you are done to access the next module."
